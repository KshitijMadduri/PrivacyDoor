# PrivacyDoor
Shhhh.......... Don't worry nobody is listening! 
An Arduino-based build to create better work-from-home environments!

The pandemic has accelerated the frequency of video-calling, be it with your loved ones or your colleagues. However, when we are restricted to our homes, the practice of video-calling gives me pet peeves. 
I constantly worry if I am being too loud, being a disturbance to my family, and sometimes if I have my privacy when needed.

 *Presenting Privacy Door!*

A simple Arduino-based solution that incorporats a KY037 Sound sensor along with an HC-SR04 Proximity sensor to solve all my problems!

A Custom made LED Strip displays the intensity of my sound levels in real-time while an UltraSonic proximity sensor is placed outside my door to notify me when someone is snooping around!

Furthermore, I can plug in any speaker with an aux port to play any ambient sound/music that will isolate my noise and prevent any disturbance to my family members.
